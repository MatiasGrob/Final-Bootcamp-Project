# Final Project - Can Demographic, Economic, and Environmental Indicators predict or explain Migration trends in a developed world?

This repository contains the final project for the bootcamp. The project explores the relationship between demographic, economic, and environmental indicators and migration trends in a developed world. It includes machine learning models for predicting migration class and net migration based on the provided dataset.
